Garrison-Chores
===============

Performing some of the daily chores at your Garrison

This is an Alliance Questing profile. It does the following:

- hearths you to the Garrison if you are not in Lunarfall already;
- exits main building 2 and 3;
- learns Draenor Secret (delayed until Anvil is met for Blacksmithing);
- picks up your Cache;
- tends the Garden 2 and 3 (order NOT placed);
- tends the Mine 2 and 3 (should do Mine 1 also but not tested): picks up the order, places the order, cleans up the mine, places the order one more time; << if you are near the mine - the profile will start from here, previous steps will be omitted.
- tends professional buildings and Salvage (small plots), for Fort level 2 and 3: old order picked up, new order placed. No expensive daily item creation: possible, but may not be optimal;
- stops at the mailbox (I am looking at addon, STM to be precise, to handle the necessary mailing, but have no recommendations so far I have played with TradeSkillMaster addon - this is not an HB addon, just a "normal" WoW addon. It may be an overkill for just mailing, but it does what I want in a couple of clicks. Take a look.).

NOT DOES things not mentioned above, including:
- no medium or big buildings served;
- no missions;
- no fishing plot service;

Thanks to Treek, Kmica, BaturalNoobs and all other participants for valuable suggestions, criticisms and encouragement.

Known problems:
- order placement made in a "dumb" way: button is pressed a fixed number of times no matter what. To be streamlined.
- there are some stucks in Garden level 3, cleared by HB anti-stuck mech. Nothing too serious, but a time waste and looks scary.

Caution:
If you are stuck inside the mine, do not press Start - Stop buttons. Use Pause - Resume instead (same button, right click). Mine is not meshed at all and full-stopping inside it will cause the profile to lose orientation completely. If you've pressed Stop in the Mine - run to the surface manually.

Upd: 1.10: - mine and garden orders are now placed smartly
- one more type of Blacksmithing Order found, added
- one more type of Mine order found, added
- minor path corrections

Upd: 1.11: - more order placements improved
- mine level 2 changed to meshed, runs fast, and humanlike: doesn't repeat paths.
- toon lower than 96 skip garden altogether

Upd. 1.12: - mount forced at some moments
- Trade Post orders placed
- mine level 2 on garrison level 3 is actually unmeshed, corrected
- vendor removed to prevent vendor run from an unmeshed area
- minor Salvage correction
